# Movie Genre Classification ðŸŽ¬

## Overview
This project is focused on classifying movie genres using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. It takes a movie title and plot description as input and predicts the most likely genre from a predefined set.

The project includes both a training pipeline and a deployed web app built with Streamlit.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, cleaning, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
- Multi-class classification (27 genres)
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**
- Deployment-ready web interface using **Streamlit**

---

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression (One-vs-Rest strategy)
- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF (top 5000 features)
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - `C = 10`
  - `solver = 'liblinear'`
  - `class_weight = 'balanced'`
  - `max_iter = 1000`

---

## Model Performance

Tested on a dataset of 54,214 movie plots:

- **Accuracy**: 76%
- **Macro F1-score**: 0.79
- **Weighted F1-score**: 0.76

The model performs well across both common and rare genres thanks to balanced class weights and TF-IDF representation.
